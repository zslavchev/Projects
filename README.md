In https://github.com/zslavchev/Projects/blob/master/netlify%20links%20for%20projects.txt file you can check all of the apps live, links are within the file.

As per the list goes, you can read a short summary of the projects.

#1 Currency Exchange Tracker

This is a simple app that is tracking few currencies and all the currency exchanges rates combination possible between them.

Currencies are fetched with an API call so we have the latest information.

#2 Dice game

A simple dice game based on refreshing the page. Upon refreshing the page, new pair of dice will be generated and will display the player with the higher number.

#3 Drum Kit

This is a simple event listener/handler driven app. Certain keystrokes are being listened for and when pressed a certain sound is being played. 

#4 Guess my number game

A simple game where you need to guess a number between 1 and 20. If you guess a number which is lower than the one that is being secretly generated, it will display a nunber that your number is lower than the generated one and vice versa (when it is higher).
If you input a number which is not in the correct range of 1 - 20, it will display a message saying that you need to input a number betweeen 1 and 20. When guessing, your score will change, e.g you start with a score of 20, when you make a wrong guess, your score changes to 19 and so on.
When you haven't guessed the number and you reach 0, you lost the game. Highscore keeps a score of the lowest number of tries it took you to guess the number.

#6 One page eCommerce shop

#7 Pig game

Pig is a simple dice game.

Gameplay:
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold": If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.

Scoring Examples
Here are two examples of how to keep score in Pig: 

Example 1: Sherri rolls a 3 and decides to continue rolling. She rolls seven more times, getting a 6, 6, 6, 4, 5, 6, and then 1. Because she rolled a 1, Sherri's turn is over and she earns 0 points for this turn.

Example 2: Craig rolls a 6 and decides to continue. He then chooses to roll four more times, getting a 3, 4, 2, and 6. He decides to hold (and not take a chance of getting a 1). Craig earns 21 points for this turn (6+3+4+2+6 = 21).

#8 Simon game

This is a memory based game. When starting at level 1, one of the four squared will blink, which means you need to memorize it and click on it. When doing so, you are passing the level.
On each new level, a new square will blink, but without showing the sequence/pattern from the beginning, it will show only the one that needs to be pressed. 
Game is infinite, it can go as long as you can memorize the correct pattern.
When you make a mistake, you start from level 1 and a new pattern. 

#9 TinDog

This is like Tinder, but for dogs. If you have a dog and it is lonely when you are coding, the puppy check it out. ;)
